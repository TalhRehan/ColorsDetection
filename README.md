Color Detection Project
This project implements a color detection application using OpenCV and Python. The application allows users to click on any pixel in an image, and it retrieves the RGB values of that pixel, identifies the corresponding color name, and displays this information on the image.

Features
Color Identification: Double-click on any part of the image to get the RGB values and the name of the detected color.
Visual Feedback: The application overlays a rectangle showing the detected color and displays the RGB values and color name on the image.
User Interaction: The application is interactive, responding to mouse clicks to enhance user engagement.
Requirements
Python
OpenCV
Pandas
A CSV file (colors.csv) containing color names and their corresponding RGB values.
Usage
Load an image by specifying its path.
Run the application and double-click on the desired pixel in the image.
View the detected color name and RGB values displayed on the image.
